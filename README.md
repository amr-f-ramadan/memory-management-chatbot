# CPPND: Memory Management Chatbot - **COMPLETED PROJECT**

✅ **Completed C++ Nanodegree Project** - Third Course: Memory Management


**This Project was first submitted on September 21, 2021. Later on, it went through some enhancments that are listed below**

This is my completed implementation of the Memory Management project from the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). This project demonstrates mastery of modern C++ memory management concepts including smart pointers, move semantics, and the Rule of Five.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The ChatBot application creates an interactive dialogue where users can ask questions about C++ memory management concepts. The system uses a knowledge graph representation where chatbot answers are graph nodes and user queries are graph edges. The Levenshtein distance algorithm identifies the most probable answers to user queries.

## 🎯 My Contributions & Achievements

This project showcases **modern C++ best practices** that I implemented to transform a basic application using raw pointers into a memory-safe, efficient system:

### ✅ **Completed All 5 Core Tasks:**

1. **Smart Pointer Implementation** - Converted raw pointers to appropriate smart pointers
2. **Rule of Five Compliance** - Implemented proper copy/move constructors and assignment operators
3. **Exclusive Ownership Design** - Established clear ownership semantics using `std::unique_ptr`
4. **Move Semantics Optimization** - Eliminated unnecessary copying with move operations
5. **Memory Safety** - Resolved all memory leaks and dangling pointer issues

### 🔧 **Additional Enhancements:**

- **⚙️ VS Code Integration**: Full development environment with CMake Tools
- **🐛 Debugging Support**: GDB integration for local development
- **🔍 Code Quality Tools**: Static analysis, formatting, and documentation generation

### 💡 **Technical Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Memory Management**: Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`), RAII principles
- **Modern C++**: Move semantics, Rule of Five, perfect forwarding
- **Design Patterns**: Ownership patterns, resource management
- **Tooling**: CMake, GDB debugging, static analysis

## 🛠️ Build & Run Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./membot`.

## 🏆 Project Implementation Details

### ✅ **Bug Fix**: Window Close Crash
**RESOLVED** - Fixed memory management issue causing crashes when closing the application window.

### 📋 **Core Memory Management Tasks Completed:**

### ✅ **Task 1: Exclusive Ownership 1** - COMPLETED
**Implementation**: Converted `_chatLogic` in `ChatbotPanelDialog` to use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership. Updated all related data structures and function parameters to reflect the new ownership model.

### ✅ **Task 2: The Rule Of Five** - COMPLETED  
**Implementation**: Modified `ChatBot` class to fully comply with the Rule of Five:
- ✅ Copy Constructor with console logging
- ✅ Copy Assignment Operator with console logging  
- ✅ Move Constructor with console logging
- ✅ Move Assignment Operator with console logging
- ✅ Destructor with proper resource cleanup

### ✅ **Task 3: Exclusive Ownership 2** - COMPLETED
**Implementation**: Refactored `_nodes` vector in `ChatLogic` to use `std::unique_ptr<GraphNode>` for exclusive ownership. Ensured non-transferring access patterns and contained changes within `ChatLogic` class.

### ✅ **Task 4: Moving Smart Pointers** - COMPLETED
**Implementation**: Redesigned `GraphEdge` ownership model:
- ✅ `GraphNode` instances exclusively own outgoing edges via `std::unique_ptr`
- ✅ Non-owning raw pointer references for incoming edges  
- ✅ Move semantics for ownership transfer from `ChatLogic` to `GraphNode`

### ✅ **Task 5: Moving the ChatBot** - COMPLETED
**Implementation**: Created stack-based `ChatBot` instance in `LoadAnswerGraphFromFile`:
- ✅ Local `ChatBot` creation on stack
- ✅ Move semantics to transfer into root node
- ✅ Eliminated `ChatLogic` ownership of `ChatBot`
- ✅ Maintained communication handle via `_chatBot` member
- ✅ Console output verification of Rule of Five method calls

## 🎓 **Project Completion Status**

| Task | Status | Key Concepts Demonstrated |
|------|--------|---------------------------|
| Bug Fix | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Memory leak debugging, RAII |
| Task 1 | ✅ **COMPLETED** | `std::unique_ptr`, exclusive ownership |
| Task 2 | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Rule of Five, copy/move semantics |
| Task 3 | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Smart pointer containers, ownership design |
| Task 4 | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Move semantics, ownership transfer |
| Task 5 | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Stack vs heap allocation, move optimization |

## 🚀 **Expected Console Output**
When running the completed application, the Rule of Five implementation produces:
```
ChatBot Constructor
ChatBot Move Constructor
ChatBot Move Assignment Operator
ChatBot Destructor
ChatBot Destructor 
```
